No delimiters when line break is already present

Abstraction combos are controlled by the user
	If two operators don't have a defined precedence relationship, they cannot be used together without brackets

Highlighting is based on semantics, not syntax

No brackets on empty lines

Bigger line height instead of empty lines as visual separators

Switch on/off different aspects of code separately
	Docs, Notes, Memory management, Error handling, etc.

Code UI
	Data is separate from its Organization & Access

	The difference between accessing a field and calling a method
		`array.length` vs `array.length()`
		`length` is either stored or computed
			if the call site doesn't care, why is the distinction made?

	Partially import external tools
		`library/Item` instead of `submodule/Item` or `library/full-path/Item`
		"I want to separate external tools from my code but also refer to them by a short name that gives me just enough context (like the library's name but not any submodule names)"

	Implicit inputs & outputs

	Value that's visually repeated but internally singular
		To achieve performance w/o sacrificing readability

Tail dedent
